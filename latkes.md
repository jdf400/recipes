## Classic Potato Latkes

These crispy, golden potato pancakes are a classic. The key to success is squeezing as much moisture as possible out of the potatoes and onions!

### Ingredients

* **2 large Russet potatoes** (approx. 1 lb), scrubbed and cut lengthwise into quarters
* **1 large onion** (8 oz), peeled and cut into quarters
* **2 large eggs**
* **½ cup** all-purpose flour

* **1 tsp** baking powder

* **Safflower oil** (or other high-heat oil) for frying

### Directions

#### 1. Grate and Dry

Using a food processor fitted with a **coarse grating disc**, grate the potatoes and onion. Immediately transfer the mixture to a clean dishtowel. Squeeze and wring the bundle forcefully to remove as much liquid as humanly possible.

#### 2. Mix the Batter

Working quickly (to prevent the potatoes from browning), transfer the dried mixture to a large bowl. Add the eggs, flour, salt, baking powder, and pepper. Mix until the flour is fully absorbed and no dry clumps remain.

#### 3. Fry until Golden

* Heat about **¼ inch of oil** in a medium heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat.
* Test the heat: a drop of batter should sizzle immediately.
* Drop heaping tablespoons of batter into the pan, working in batches to avoid crowding.
* Use a spatula to flatten them into discs.
* **First Side:** Cook until the edges are brown and crispy (about 5 minutes).
* **Second Side:** Flip and cook until deeply browned (about 5 more minutes).

#### 4. Drain and Season

Transfer the latkes to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. **Sprinkle with salt while still warm** to ensure it sticks. Repeat with the remaining batter.
