INGREDIENTS:
-6 large bell peppers (I did 2 yellow, 2 red, and 2 green)
-1 lb ground beef or ground turkey
-2 tbsp taco seasoning
-3/4 cup canned and drained black beans
-3/4 cup canned and drained corn-1 jalapeño diced (optional)-1 cup Mexican shredded cheese
DIRECTIONS:
-Preheat oven to 375°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.-Core the stem from the pepper, slice the pepper in half, then slice each half into 3 equal parts. Each pepper will create 6 “chips”. Place the bell pepper chips on the prepared baking sheet with the insides facing up.-In a large skillet, stir the ground beef until cooked throughly. Add taco seasoning and stir. Add black beans, corn, and jalapeños. Mix until well combined.
-Spoon the mixture over the bell pepper pieces. Sprinkle the cheese on top and bake about 10 mins until the cheese melts.
