### Directions

1. **Prep the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 375°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.
2. **Prepare the "Chips":** * Core the stem from each pepper and slice in half.
* Slice each half into 3 equal parts (each pepper creates 6 chips).
* Arrange the bell pepper chips on the baking sheet with the insides facing up.


3. **Cook the Filling:** In a large skillet, cook the ground beef until thoroughly browned. Stir in the taco seasoning. Add the black beans, corn, and jalapeños, mixing until well combined.
4. **Assemble and Bake:** Spoon the meat mixture evenly over the bell pepper pieces. Sprinkle the shredded cheese on top.
5. **Finish:** Bake for approximately **10 minutes** or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

**Pro Tip:** Serve these with a dollop of Greek yogurt (a great sour cream sub) or some fresh avocado!
