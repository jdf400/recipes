### Directions

1. **Prep Spices:** In a small bowl, combine the oregano, salt, black pepper, cumin, paprika, and red pepper flakes. Set aside.
2. **Cream the Cheese:** Blend the cottage cheese in a blender, food processor, or with an immersion blender until completely smooth. Set aside.
3. **Sauté Aromatics:** Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Once shimmering, add the onion and jalapeño. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is translucent and beginning to brown (**5–7 minutes**).
4. **Toast Spices:** Add the garlic and the prepared spice mix. Cook until fragrant (**1–2 minutes**), stirring constantly to prevent burning.
5. **Simmer:** Mix in the beans, corn, and green chilis. Pour in the broth and turn the heat to high to bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and simmer for **10–15 minutes**.
6. **Finish & Serve:** Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the blended cottage cheese, shredded chicken, cilantro, lime juice, and lime zest. Salt to taste and serve immediately with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro.

> **Tip:** If you want it even thicker, you can mash a handful of the white beans against the side of the pot before adding the chicken!
