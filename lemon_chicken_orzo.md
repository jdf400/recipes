### **Method**

#### **1. Sear the Chicken**

Season the diced chicken with ½ tsp salt, the paprika, and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for **3–4 minutes** until mostly cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside.

#### **2. Toast the Orzo & Veggies**

In the same pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Sauté the onions for **3–4 minutes**. Add the uncooked orzo and toast for **2 minutes**, stirring frequently. Stir in the grated zucchini and garlic, cooking for another **2 minutes** until the onions are tender.

#### **3. Simmer**

Pour in the chicken stock, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Add the thyme, salt, and pepper. Return the chicken to the pot. Cover with a lid, reduce heat to **medium-low**, and simmer for **8–10 minutes**.

> **Note:** Stir occasionally during this time to prevent the orzo from sticking to the bottom.

#### **4. The Creamy Finish**

Once the orzo is tender and the liquid is mostly absorbed, stir in the light cream. Remove from the heat and fold in the mozzarella and feta until melted and gooey.

#### **5. Serve**

Garnish with fresh parsley and an extra crack of black pepper. Enjoy!

**Top Tip:** If the sauce gets too thick while sitting, splash in a little extra chicken stock or water to loosen it back up.
