Ingredients
•1/2 tbs olive oil
•500g Chicken
•1/2 tsp paprika
•1tbs butter
•1 small onion, diced
•2 garlic cloves, minced (or 1 tsp powder)
•1 cup orzo pasta/ risoni (uncooked)
•1 medium zucchini, grated
•2 cups low sodium chicken stock
•zest and juice of 1 small lemon
•1/2 tsp each dried thyme salt, pepper
•1/2 cup of light cream (I used Philadelphia 60% less fat light cooking cream)

Add ins:
•30-40g Mozzarella
•30g crumbly feta
•Fresh Parsley

Method:
Season the chicken with 1/2 tsp salt, paprika and pepper.

Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Add chicken and cook until the chicken is mostly cooked 3-4 minutes. Remove the chicken and set aside.

Melt the butter in the same pan over medium-high heat. Add onions and sauté for 3-4 minutes. Add orzo and toast for 2 minutes in the pan. Add the grated zucchini, garlic and cook for an additional 2 minutes or until the onions are tender.

Add in the chicken stock, lemon zest and juice. Season with the salt, pepper and thyme. Stir the chicken back into the pot and cover with a lid, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 8-10 minutes or until orzo is tender. Stir throughout the cook time to ensure the pasta does not stick to the bottom of the pot.

Once the orzo is cooked through, add the cream and stir until

Combined. Remove from heat and stir through the feta, mozzarella until all melted through. Season with salt, pepper and fresh parsley and enjoy!
