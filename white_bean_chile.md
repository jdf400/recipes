1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon kosher salt, additional to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
1 1⁄2 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, diced
1 jalapeño pepper, seeds removed and diced
3 garlic cloves, minced
15 ounce can cannellini beans (or navy or great northern beans), drained and rinsed
1 1/2 cups corn kernels (15-ounce can, drained, fresh, or frozen)
4 ounce can green chiles
32 ounces (4 cups) reduced-sodium chicken broth
16 ounces 4% milkfat cottage cheese, blended smooth with a blender, food processor, or immersion blender
3 cups shredded rotisserie chicken (or pound boneless chicken breast, cooked and shredded)
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, roughly chopped, additional for garnish
juice and zest of 1 lime


Directions
1) Add oregano, salt, black pepper, cumin, paprika, and red pepper flakes to a small bowl. Mix to combine and set aside.
2) Heat the oil in a large pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion and jalapeño. Cook, stirring often until the onion is translucent and beginning to brown, 5 to 7 minutes.
3) Stir in the garlic and spice mix. Cook, stirring often until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
4) Mix in the cannellini beans, corn, and green chilis. Cover with the broth and bring the mixture to a gentle bowl, then reduce heat to low.
5) Stir in the blended cottage cheese, rotisserie chicken, cilantro, lime juice, and lime zest. Salt to taste and simmer on low to let the flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately or keep low heat until serving. Top each bowl with a sprinkle of chopped cilantro.
