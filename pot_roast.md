This hearty, slow-cooked pot roast is the ultimate comfort meal. Searing the beef first locks in the flavor, while the low-and-slow oven braise makes the meat fall-apart tender.

### 🔪 Instructions

1. **Prep & Sear:** Preheat your oven to **300°F**. Season the roast generously with salt and pepper. In your Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Sear the roast on all sides until well-browned (about 4 minutes per side).
2. **Aromatics:** Arrange the chopped onions around the beef. In a small bowl, whisk together the broth, wine, garlic, rosemary, and thyme. Pour the mixture over the roast and add the bay leaf.
3. **The First Braise:** Bring the liquid to a simmer on the stovetop. Once simmering, cover the pot and transfer it to the oven. Cook for **2 hours**.
4. **Add Vegetables:** Carefully remove the pot and add the potatoes, carrots, and celery. Cover and return to the oven for another **2 hours** (for a 4lb roast) or until both the meat and potatoes are fork-tender.
5. **Serve:** Discard the bay leaf. Use a fork to pull the beef into large chunks or slice into thick pieces. Serve with the natural pan juices or proceed to make gravy.

> **Tip:** If you prefer a thicker gravy, whisk together equal parts melted butter and flour (roux) or a cornstarch slurry, then whisk it into the hot pan juices on the stovetop until thickened.
