### **Instructions**

#### **1. Marinate**

Place the chicken breasts in a resealable bag or airtight container. Add the lemon juice, olive oil, smashed garlic, salt, pepper, and chili flakes. Massage the bag to ensure the chicken is evenly coated.

* **Time:** Marinate in the fridge **overnight** (or for at least 4 hours) for the best flavor penetration.

#### **2. Air Fry**

1. Pre-heat your air fryer to **400°F**.
2. Place the chicken in the basket, ensuring they aren't overlapping.
3. Cook for **15–20 minutes**.
4. **The Target:** Use a meat thermometer to ensure the thickest part of the breast reaches an internal temperature of **165°F**.

#### **3. Rest**

Let the chicken rest for **5 minutes** before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute so the meat stays tender.
