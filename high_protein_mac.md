This sounds like a fantastic, high-protein take on Mac & Cheese. Using cottage cheese for the base is a total pro move for that creamy texture without the heavy cream.

### Instructions

1. **Prep the Pasta:** Cook the macaroni according to package directions in salted water. **Reserve at least 4 tbsp of pasta water** before draining. Drain the pasta and set aside.
2. **Blend the Sauce:** In a blender, combine the cottage cheese, milk, nutritional yeast, shredded cheddar, garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, and onion powder. Blend until completely smooth.
3. **Create the Slurry:** In a small dish, whisk together the reserved pasta water and the cornstarch until no lumps remain.
4. **Thicken the Sauce:** Pour the blended cheese sauce into a small pan over medium heat. Bring it to a light simmer. Stir in the cornstarch mixture.
5. **Simmer:** Continue to cook for about **5 minutes**, stirring constantly to prevent the cheese from burning or sticking to the bottom. Cook until the sauce reaches your desired thickness.
> *Tip: If it feels too thick, splash in a little more milk; if you want it cheesier, stir in an extra handful of cheddar here!*


6. **Combine:** Add the cooked pasta directly into the sauce. Toss well to coat every noodle and serve immediately.
