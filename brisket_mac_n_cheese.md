### **Ingredients**

#### **The Brisket**

* **900g (32oz)** flat cut brisket, fat removed
* **400g (14oz) can** crushed fire-roasted tomatoes
* **120g (½ cup)** red enchilada sauce
* **200g (7oz) can** chipotle peppers in adobo
* **45g (3 Tbsp)** green chiles
* **60g (3 Tbsp)** honey
* **1 Tbsp** salt
* **2 tsp** onion powder
* **2 tsp** black pepper

#### **The Pasta**

* **672g** pasta, cooked to 50% (boil for only half the time shown on the box)

#### **Blended Queso Sauce**

* **800g (3 ⅓ cups)** 2% cottage cheese
* **100g (1 cup)** American cheese
* **150g (1 ½ cups)** extra sharp cheddar cheese

### **Instructions**

1. **Slow Cook the Beef:** Place the trimmed brisket and all "Brisket" ingredients into the slow cooker.
* **Low:** 5–6+ hours (Recommended)
* **High:** 4–5 hours


2. **Prepare the Sauce:** While the beef cooks, place all "Blended Queso Sauce" ingredients into a blender. Blend until completely smooth. If the consistency is too thick to pour, add milk in small increments.
3. **Prepare the Pasta:** Boil your pasta until it is only 50% cooked (half the box instructions), then drain.
4. **Combine:** Once the brisket is tender, shred the meat directly in the pot. Add the par-cooked pasta and the blended queso sauce.
5. **Final Simmer:** Switch the slow cooker to **High** and cook for an additional **20–25 minutes** until the pasta is tender and the sauce is hot.

### **Pro Tips & Notes**

* **Trimming:** Trimming all exterior fat from the flat cut brisket makes it a very lean protein source. You can ask your butcher to do this or do it easily at home.
* **Substitutions:** While brisket offers the best flavor-to-leanness ratio, you can use any preferred cut of beef.
* **Spice Level:** To reduce the heat, remove the seeds from the chipotle peppers before adding them to the slow cooker.
