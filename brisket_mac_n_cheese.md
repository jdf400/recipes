2 tsp onion powder
2 tsp black pepper

High: 4-5 hours

672g pasta, cooked to 50%

Blended Queso Sauce:
800g (3 â…“ cups) 2% cottage cheese
100g (1 cup) American cheese
150g (1 Â½ cups) extra sharp cheddar cheese
80g (â…“ cup) red enchilada sauce
5g (1 tsp) nutritional yeast
Salt/pepper

IF sauce is too thick, add ~120-240ml of milk until pourable consistency

Cook the Brisket with ingrediants for 5-6 hours on low. Add cooked pasta and cheese sauve and cook high for 20-25

Additional notes:
Trimming all exterior fat from flat cut brisket is what makes it a super lean cut. You can ask your butcher to do this at the counter, but it is also easy to remove at home. Additionally, you can use any preferred cut of beef for this, but brisket has the best flavor-to-leanness ratio and has great texture
If you want less spice, remove the seeds from the chipotle peppers before adding
